This project involved creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze and visualize loan data, providing insights into the dynamics of borrowing and lending practices in the financial sector. The dashboard offers a comprehensive exploration of a large dataset from LendingClub, covering loan applications and borrower profiles from 2007 to 2018.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Undertook rigorous data cleaning to address inconsistencies and missing values, ensuring the integrity of the dataset, which comprised over 5.7 million loan applications and 115 columns of financial data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted EDA to uncover patterns, relationships, and correlations within the data, focusing on key attributes such as loan amounts, interest rates, borrower income, and loan status.

### Tableau Dashboard Design:
Developed three distinct dashboardsâ€”Loan Purpose Analysis, Loan Distribution Analysis, and Loan Grade Analysis. These dashboards utilized various visualization techniques to present key findings, including trends in loan purposes, distribution of loan amounts across states, and the impact of borrower grades on loan performance.

### Key Insights:
Identified significant trends, such as the variation in average interest rates over time, the dominance of certain loan purposes like Debt Consolidation and Credit Card, and the distribution of loans across different states and borrower grades. These insights provide valuable context for understanding the financial landscape and borrower behaviors during the specified period.

### Interactive Elements:
Incorporated interactive features within the dashboards, allowing users to dynamically explore the data, filter by specific criteria, and gain deeper insights into the factors influencing loan approval and performance.

The project delivers an accessible and insightful tool for analyzing loan data, revealing crucial trends and patterns that inform lending strategies and borrower risk assessments. The visualizations enhance the understanding of the financial landscape from 2007 to 2018, offering a valuable resource for stakeholders in the finance industry.
